                <span>The primary clientele of the @@One poster printing service is University of Nevada Reno students, faculty, and staff printing one-off posters for scholarly activities such as homework assignments, professional conference poster sessions, and college or department show-and-tell presentations.  An important but secondary clientele is departments, colleges, and university organizations requesting batch promotional print jobs (a batch job is defined as any request for more than 5 copies of a single print).</span>
                <br /><br />
                <b>To assure that we meet the needs of our primary clientele in a timely manner the following guidelines are established:</b>

                    <li class="eula">Poster requests from primary clientele have top priority; these requests will be filled within 24 business hours, following payment and receipt of the poster print file;</li>
                    <li class="eula">Orders should be picked up within 3 business days. Unclaimed orders after that time may be recycled or thrown away, with no refund or reprint given;</li>
                    <li class="eula">Keep in mind that all images will print darker than what is seen on the computer screen. If color and/or brightness is important to you, let us know during the ordering process.  There will be no free reprints based on color gamut or brightness issues;</li>
